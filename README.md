# Twibbon
Twibbon is a social media tool that allows users to overlay images, such as ribbons or badges, onto their profile pictures to show support for a particular cause, event, or campaign. It's often used in conjunction with hashtags to create a unified visual presence across various social media platforms. Twibbon makes it easy for individuals and organizations to customize their profile pictures for a specific purpose, whether it's raising awareness for a charity, celebrating an event, or expressing solidarity with a movement. Users can create their own custom Twibbons or choose from a library of existing ones.
